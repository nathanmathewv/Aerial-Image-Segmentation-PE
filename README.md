# Aerial Image Segmentation for Buildings and Roads

A collection of deep learning models designed to predict and segment buildings and roads from satellite imagery. This repository includes multiple architectures, each exploring different methodologies to enhance segmentation accuracy.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

* `K-Means-Clustering/`: Applies K-Means clustering for unsupervised segmentation.
* `Patched-Based CNN/`: Implements a CNN trained on image patches for localized feature learning.
* `Res2UNet/`: Combines ResNet and U-Net architectures to leverage deep residual learning for segmentation.
* `Stacked-UNet-Building-Extraction/`: Utilizes a stacked U-Net approach specifically tailored for building extraction.
* `UNet_ECBA/`: Enhances the traditional U-Net with Efficient Channel and Batch Attention mechanisms.
* `README.md`: Provides an overview and details about the repository.

## Model Descriptions

### 1. K-Means Clustering

An unsupervised learning approach that segments images based on pixel intensity similarities. While simple, it serves as a baseline for comparison with more complex models.

### 2. Patch-Based CNN

This model divides images into smaller patches, allowing the CNN to focus on localized features. Such an approach can capture fine-grained details, especially useful in heterogeneous regions.

### 3. Res2UNet

Integrates the deep residual learning capabilities of ResNet with the encoder-decoder structure of U-Net. This fusion aims to improve feature propagation and segmentation accuracy.

### 4. Stacked U-Net for Building Extraction

Employs multiple U-Net models stacked sequentially, refining the segmentation output at each stage. This iterative enhancement is particularly effective for delineating building structures.

### 5. U-Net with ECBA Attention

Augments the standard U-Net with Efficient Channel and Batch Attention modules, enabling the model to focus on more informative features and improving segmentation performance.

## Dataset

The models are trained and evaluated on satellite imagery datasets annotated for building and road segmentation. Specific dataset details, including sources and preprocessing steps, are provided within each model's directory.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nathanmathewv/Aerial-Image-Segmentation-PE.git
   ```



2. **Navigate to a Model Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Aerial-Image-Segmentation-PE/Res2UNet
   ```



3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Each model may have its own set of dependencies. Refer to the `requirements.txt` or documentation within the specific model directory.

4. **Train or Evaluate the Model:**

   Follow the instructions provided in the respective model's README or scripts to train or evaluate the model.

## Evaluation Metrics

Models are assessed using standard segmentation metrics:

* **Accuracy:** Proportion of correctly classified pixels.
* **Intersection over Union (IoU):** Measures the overlap between predicted and ground truth segments.
* **Dice Coefficient:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, emphasizing the accuracy of positive class predictions.([Medium][2])
